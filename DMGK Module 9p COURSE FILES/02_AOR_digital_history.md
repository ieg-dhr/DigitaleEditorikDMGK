## AOR and Digital History

In this part of the first session, we will discuss the link between academic research and digital editions, and the modelling and structuring of historical data in particular. We will do so by focusing on a completed academic project, namely 'The Archaeology of Reading in Early Modern Europe', an international collaboration between the Centre of Editing Lives and Letters at University College London, Johns Hopkins University, and Princeton University.

## Homework

Please read two texts which are to be found in this folder [here](https://gitlab.rlp.net/teaching-dhlab/dmgk-seminar-digitale-editorik/-/tree/master/Literature%20-%20session%201):


- Lisa Jardine and Anthony Grafton, “‘Studied for Action’: How Gabriel Harvey Read His Livy,” _Past and Present_ 129 (1990)
- M. T. Symonds and Jaap Geraerts, “XML and the ‘Archaeology of Reading’”, in: H. Philips, C. B. Williams (Eds.), A handbook of editing early modern texts (Routledge, 2017)

If you have the time and/or energy, you also might want to consult the short introduction on the discipline of Book History here:

https://archaeologyofreading.org/historiography/

Further reading on this topic can be found in this short bibliography:

It would be good, too, if you can have a look at and play around with the AOR viewer before the start of class:

## In-class activities

Together we will discuss the abovementioned pieces. Please have a think about the following topics when reading the article by Jardine and Grafton:

- What is the central argument made by Jardine and Grafton?
- What information must be captured in order to be able to study Harvey's reading practices?
- What are important topics which can be addressed through the study of annotated books? Do annotated books contain information on topics which are not necessarily associated with the history of reading/history of the book?

After this discussion, I will present a couple of aspects of the AOR project. The presentation will be made available [here](https://gitlab.rlp.net/teaching-dhlab/dmgk-seminar-digitale-editorik/-/tree/master/Presentations). This will be followed by a hands-on session with the AOR viewer (more information about this activity can be found [here](https://gitlab.rlp.net/teaching-dhlab/dmgk-seminar-digitale-editorik/-/blob/master/03_hands-on.md).
