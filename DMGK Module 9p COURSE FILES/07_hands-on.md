## Encoding letters in break-out groups

We will put you in 3 or 4 groups, that means in teams of 2 or 3 people each.

You will be given one German, illustrated *Geburtsbrief* from our small [collection](https://seafile.rlp.net/d/9e993e6da6354fc6ac5c/) to work on a transcription and to start encoding.

Your homework will be to finish this at home and also tackle one foreign-language *Geburtsbrief*.

You will be asked to keep in touch with your break-out team after class to compare your ideas as you will be working on the same sources.

## Alternative XML editors

If your Oxygen licence has expired, you can open and edit XML files with the open source software [BaseX](https://basex.org/).

BaseX is not as advanced as Oxygen when it comes to automated error detection in XML, but it is very good for running XQuery and has some nice data visualisation features.

Alternatively, you may want to use the [Sublime Text Editor](https://www.sublimetext.com/). It is an easy to use and reliable text editor for all kinds of code. It will highlight code structures in different colours and has a good search option to find element.

It is not a tool for absolute beginners but handy for advanced users.
