### General learning outcomes

The idea of this course is to have the students create a boutique digital edition of a primary source from the early modern era in order to make them familiar with what we might call the process of ‘digital translation’, i.e. a ‘translatio’ (transference/translation) of a primary manuscript source into a digital environment. This process requires a sound understanding of the main characteristics of printed (scholarly) editions and the methods of the traditional humanities as well as a sure command of several more technical skills. In order to marry this robust humanistic and technical knowledge, the students will be directly and actively involved in all the necessary steps for the aforementioned translatio, including traditional source criticism, the creation of an XML schema, the deployment of transcriptions in a web environment, the creation of a proper editorial policy and contextual material, and so forth. 
The desired outcomes of this course are twofold: on the one hand, students will acquire particular (technical) skills, including the creation of an XML schema, the transcription of early modern sources in XML, and the ability to display the transcriptions as well as contextual information online, partly via X-technologies. On the other hand, students will get insight into the complex editorial decisions that underpin digital editions and the ramifications these decisions might have on the academic investigations both printed and digital scholarly editions aim to further.
