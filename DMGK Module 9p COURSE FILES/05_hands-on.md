In this part of the second session, we're going to have a look at [selected Geburtsbriefe](https://seafile.rlp.net/d/9e993e6da6354fc6ac5c/) and discuss which aspects of these sources we should capture and how (in XML). First, we will briefly discuss the article by Andrew Hardie (see [here](https://gitlab.rlp.net/teaching-dhlab/dmgk-seminar-digitale-editorik/-/tree/master/Literature%20-%20session%202)) which is part of the homework for this session:

Andrew Hardie, “Modest XML for Corpora: Not a standard, but a suggestion,” _ICAME Journal_ 38 (2014)

Regarding Hardie's article:
- What is his main argument?
- What do you think of his suggestion?
- To what extent should we make use of existing standards in our research projects?

We will now ask you to work in teams of 2s or 3s, depending on your language skills. Every group will work on one German "Geburtsbrief", but while one group will also transcribe a document in French, two other groups will transcribe one in Latin.

It helps if at least one person per group knows Latin or French. If not, Monika and Jaap will help.

The three groups will work on the following items:

| Team 1 | Team 2 |Team 3 |
| ------ | ------ |------ |
| G_16850731_FR.JPG | G_16850801_LAT.JPG |G_16960102_LAT.JPG |
| G_16850731_v.JPG | G_17690822.JPG |G_17410300.JPG |
| G_17980302_r.JPG | | |
| G_17980302_v.JPG | | |

Please complete the following tasks regarding your *Mainzer Geburtsbriefe*:

- Look at the metadata of the early modern Geburtsbriefe kept by Stadtarchiv Mainz and find your archival IDs in the list. Discuss what aspects of the metadata should also be captured in our XML files / the schema:
https://seafile.rlp.net/f/08948c0b79154478a8c9/

- Look at the *Geburtsbriefe* we have selected for your team and consider their structure in the light of Hardie's article:
https://seafile.rlp.net/d/9e993e6da6354fc6ac5c/

How can the different textual and visual elements be implemented in an XML schema? Which elements are important? Which elements may be ignored?

If you are NOT confident updating Jaap's draft schema, simply make a list of elements you want to capture as an .md file and upload it to the [xml schema folder](https://gitlab.rlp.net/teaching-dhlab/dmgk-seminar-digitale-editorik/-/tree/master/XML%20schema) in our repository.
