## AOR Hands-on Session

In this session, we will focus on the data that is contained within the AOR viewer, the way in which it's structured, and made operational. For the time being, we won't focus on the user interface; this is one of the topics in the seventh and last session of this course.

The AOR viewer can be accessed [here](https://archaeologyofreading.org/viewer/#aor).

For a short explanation of the basic functionalities of the viewer, click [here](https://archaeologyofreading.org/user-manual/). 

### Questions: the XML schema and the accompanying documentation

1) What is your first impression when you look at the XML schema ? Overly detailed, lacking necessary information, not well structured?
    For the DTD, see [here](https://github.com/livesandletters/aor/blob/master/XMLschema/aor2_18112016.dtd). The XSD can be found [here](https://github.com/livesandletters/aor/blob/master/XMLschema/aor2_18112016.xsd)

2) Have a look at the large Transcriber’s Manual, [here](https://archaeologyofreading.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2019/04/AOR2_Transcribers_Manual_29012019.pdf). Do you find this a helpful way of documenting a schema and the editorials decisions behind it? Why/why not? What would you do differently?

### Questions: finding information in the AOR viewer

1) You’re interested in finding out about the interactions of the readers with the theme “war”. What are your research strategies? How easy is it to find information to start answering such a question? P.S. War is just a suggestion, pick any theme you like, the important thing is to work with the AOR viewer. Be creative!

2) How would you try to find out which conversations between books in the libraries are going on? Hint: one can also search in the raw transcriptions rather than in the viewer!

3) How would you go about tracking change over time in the reading practices of both readers? Does the structure of the data offer any starting points?

### Questions: AOR as a digital edition

1) Would the AOR transcriptions suffice as a scholarly edition? Or are elements missing? If so, can these be easily included in a digital research environment like this one? What would you do differently?
