# Reflecting on web interfaces for digital editions

Please read the following article on interface design at home:

https://gitlab.rlp.net/teaching-dhlab/dmgk-seminar-digitale-editorik/-/tree/master/Literature%20-%20session%207

Jaap will tell us about interface decisions in AOR and discuss interfaces as an integral part of the edition.

# XML and RDF: research examples for working with linked data

To follow up on the topics of Linked Data and Semantic Web, Jaap will show how AOR integrated RDF and analysed data as a graph.

A good introduction to RDF (including XML/RDF) is: https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-syntax-grammar/

The transformation of XML to RDF with XSLT is explained here: https://www.w3.org/community/rax/wiki/XML_to_RDF_Transformation_processes_using_XSLT

The following article covers the question when XML to RDF conversions make sense and what research questions can be answered through the Linked Data approach:
