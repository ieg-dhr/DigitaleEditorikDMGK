## XML schema development ##


In class we will start analysing the sources, develop tags, and work towards the creation of a fully fledged XML schema. I started with a schema (see [here](https://gitlab.rlp.net/teaching-dhlab/dmgk-seminar-digitale-editorik/-/tree/master/XML%20schema)), just to capture some metadata, but its structure isn't set in stone, far from it. The idea is that you, the students, think about, discuss, and develop the schema. Monika and I are mostly there in the capacity of facilitators!
