# Hands-on session on the basics of XML encoding

Letters 1916-1923 is Irelandâ€™s first participatory digital humanities project. Begun in September 2013, it collects letters, telegraphs, postcards and notes relating to Ireland's fight for independence and the early years of the Republic. All letters are made public and transcribed by hundreds of volunteers across the world. These volunteers use simple XML encoding ("hidden" behind buttons in a task bar) to mark up different sections of the letters and to highlight specific words or phrases.

Log in as "Sherlock Holmes" (details below) on the [Letters 1916-1923 website](http://letters1916.maynoothuniversity.ie/) and open the pages of the (partly) transcribed letter in MY TRANSCRIPTIONS.

The log-in details are:

1) Look at the icons in the task bar and in the transcription. Can you match those icons with the following XML tags and explain their function? Be aware that TWO of the tags in the table below do NOT correspond to an icon but to pressing certain keys on your keyword. Can you find these, too? If you need help, simply consult our [sample letter](http://letters1916.maynoothuniversity.ie/learn/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Sample-letter-and-instructions-for-transcribers.pdf).

| XML tag  |  Function of tag |  Icon in Letters 1916-1923? |
|---|---|---|
| `<p>` | ? | ? | 
| `<hi rend="underline">`  | ? | ? |
| `<unclear>`  | ? | ? | 
| `<del>` | ? | ? | 
| `<hi rend="subscript">` | ? | ? | 
| `<hi rend="superscript">` | ? | ? | 
| `<lb/>` | ? | ? |
| `<sic>` |  ? | ?  | 
| `<address>` | ? | ? |
| `<salute>` |  ? |  ? | 
| `<add>` | ? | ? | 
| `<note place="margin">` | ? | ? | 
| `<date>` | ?  |  ? | 
| `<foreign>` |  ? |  ? | 


In case there is an issue with the database access, you can also use this screenshot to identify the icons in the transcription task bar:

2) If you have time, read the existing transcription more carefully. Is any mark-up missing that you would like to add? Can you spot any mistakes? Are the paragraphs and line-breaks correct? The [transcription guidelines](http://letters1916.maynoothuniversity.ie/wp-post/how-to-transcribe) for our volunteers might help. Discuss your ideas for improvement with your break-out group but do NOT edit the actual file as all the others are using it, too.

3) What different aspects of the text are captured by the tags that can be added by the transcribers? What informational layers are NOT encoded?

***

4) Why is encoding a whole collection of letters useful?
