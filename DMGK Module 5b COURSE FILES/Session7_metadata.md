## Making the most of metadata in XML/TEI

## Understanding metadata

This video by Prof. Susan Schreibman (now at Maastricht University) explains the role of metadata when using markup:

<div align="left">

         <img src="https://img.youtube.com/vi/E7-g17oL7w0/0.jpg" style="width:100%;">
      </a>
</div>

Questions:
1. What is the difference between "data" and "metadata"?
2. Why are metadata important to digital humanists?
2. Where have you come across metadata in your work as a student?

## Handling metadata in XML/TEI

The boundaries between the data types are not always clear. Often it depends on a concrete use case whether, for example, a date belongs to the "data" or the "metadata", and this affects the encoding process and where the data are stored in XML.
In XML, it is possible to include meta information not only in the header of the XML file, but also, for example, as an attribute inside certain tags.

Please check the following examples on Stackoverflow:

## Use cases in DH

**LETTERS 1916-1923**, the Irish edition of early-20th-century letters, faced the following metadata problems:

* Metadata were provided by different contributing archives, libraries and private collectors varied in quality and quantity.
* The multilingual nature of the collection (including material in English, Irish, French and German) required special care.
* The disambiguation of people and places was not always possible.
* Names of people and places often came in both English and Irish.
* Especially when envolopes were missing, dates and places could not be identified at all.
* Irish revolutionaries used fake placenames and nicknames to confuse censors.
* Categorising / tagging all letters in a concise yet meaningful way was challenging.
* The structure of our metadata and the design of our interface had to cater to users with no knowledge of Irish history as well as experts.

Please discuss in your break-out group how you would handle these problems in a digital edition. How would you try and handle them in your encoding?
