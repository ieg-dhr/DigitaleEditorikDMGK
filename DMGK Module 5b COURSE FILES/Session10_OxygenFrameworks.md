## The purpose of "frameworks" in digital editing

Frameworks are standard procedures for the creation of XML files and other elements of a digital edition. A framework guarantees that tasks which are often repeated are performed in the same way throughout the project and that different contributors adopt one workflow. Especially in large edition projects that go on for many years and have a high turnover of staff, frameworks can be helpful. We are not teaching you how to set them up in Oxygen, but you should know that they exist as you might come across frameworks in your future employment.

## (Custom) frameworks in Oxygen

In the humanities, the majority of editing projects are using Oxygen and eXist-db. Although Oxygen licences are expensive, the software is very popular because of its possibilities to create custom framework for specific projects. A framework contains extensible features and graphical user interfaces to control and enhance the complete editing workflow. Oxygen frameworks also provide document type mapping for a large number of XML standards (e.g. TEI).

Oxygen XML Editor includes built-in, configured frameworks for DocBook, DITA, TEI, XHTML, and JATS, but you can also create your own customization to handle other types of documents. A common use case is wanting to customize the interface to accommodate the needs of your authoring team.

Fully configuring a framework usually involves customizing CSS stylesheets, XML schemas, GUI components (menu actions, toolbars, inline components, content completion proposals, and more), configuring other more general settings, then bundling the framework to share with your team. The CSS and GUI components are used to customize the interface, while other general settings can be configured to accommodate custom document templates, XML catalogs, transformation scenarios, and more."

## EDIARUM -- a standard framework for digital editing in the humanities

EDIARUM was developed at Leipzig University and is the best-known framework for digital editing in the German-speaking world.

It is fully based on Oxygen and eXist-db.
