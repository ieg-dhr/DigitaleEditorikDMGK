# Introduction to text-encoding with XML

## What is structured data and why do we need it in the humanities?

Watch the following #dariahTeach video by Prof. Elena Piarezzo (Grenoble) and try to answer the three questions below:


<div align="left">
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/R0ncI_rr1z4">
         <img src="https://img.youtube.com/vi/R0ncI_rr1z4/0.jpg" style="width:100%;">
      </a>
</div>

Questions: 
1. What are the reasons for encoding given in the video?
2. What are the sources presented as examples?
3. Why would encoding be useful for the (humanities) projects you have worked on as a student or research assistant?

## Markup as a way to structure and interpret text

One attempt to unify the description and analysis of texts across languages was the development of "markup". Markup is a set of signs that are added to a source to create links between words or to others texts, sort sources by date, identify authors or provide additional context. It is important to note that markup predates the digital age as markup was (and is!) also used in the form of handwritten instructions to a printer. Digital standard procedures to encode text are markup languages. The most commonly used markup language for digital text-based editions in the humanities is XML.

*For samples of manuscript markup, please see [“Deciphering Copyediting Markup” by Ella Dyson, 14th December 14 2017](https://writersblockpartyblog.com/2017/12/14/deciphering-copyediting-markup/).*

## Overview of markup languages and their development

The "mother" of modern markup languages is SGML (Standard Generalized Markup Language), defined as an ISO standard. SGML descended from IBM's Generalized Markup Language (GML), which Charles Goldfarb, Edward Mosher, and Raymond Lorie developed in the 1960s. 

[A Gentle Introduction to SGML](https://tei-c.org/Vault/GL/P3/SG.htm):

> SGML is an international standard for the description of marked-up electronic text. More exactly, SGML is a metalanguage, that is, a means of formally describing a language, in this case, a markup language.

This means that SGML is not itself a markup language, i.e. there are *no fixed markups* for certain text elements. SGML defines the syntax in which users can define their own markup languages. The SGML-based markup language most people outside academia are familiar with is probably HTML, which is used to encode content for display on the web. HTML has seen many updates and variations over time. HTML5 is the latest version of HTML, recommended by the [World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)](https://www.w3.org/).  

XML (eXtensible Markup Language) was first recommended by W3C in 1998 and, according to the [W3Schools XML Tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/xml/), serves the following two purposes:

> XML was designed to store and transport data.
XML was designed to be both human- and machine-readable.

[A Gentle Introduction to XML](https://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/SG.html):

> XML is widely used for the definition of device-independent, system-independent methods of storing and processing texts in electronic form. It is now also the interchange and communication format used by many applications on the World Wide Web.

As such, XML is also particularly suitable for digital editions in the humanities.

The *Timeline of Markup Languages*, published in [“Markup Language for the Wireless World”, 5th February 2009](https://mobilewireless.wordpress.com/2009/02/05/markup-language-for-the-wireless-world/), provides a useful visualisation.

You may also want to read the following introduction to markup languages and their history: [#dariahTeach: Markup Languages and text modelling](https://teach.dariah.eu/mod/lesson/view.php?id=21)

What markup languages have you seen or maybe even used before? Are the different use cases clear?

Write down questions or comments you want to discuss with the class.
