Clonmel August, 19th 180[8]	Private
My Dear Sir Edward
However prepared I might have been for unpleasant intelligence on the subject of poor Mr Traill, the sudden and unexpected account of his death has shocked me much and I participate in the feeling of all knew him, when I recall his value to the publick and his worth as a man.
I have given to Brigade Major [Crauford] and to the Brigade Major from Waterford all necessary Instructions for the purpose of making enquiries as to Foley in the effectual and most secret mission – Crawford who seems a very intelligent man is convinced that either the Information is false or that greatest information has been practised upon Mr Robbins who he represents from his own knowledge to be a man of exemplary loyalty and good conduct.
I am very happy to announce to you from the Information of General Crawford of the Brigade Major of the [Council?] for the Crown and of the [?] of the best informed Gentlemen of the County  ( among whom I reckon the [?] Mr Mahon a Roman Catholick Clergy who gave [great?] assistance to Serjant [Maare[ and me upon the publick prosecutions here last Spring) that the state of this County has very much improved.  The Catholick Clergy have immeasurably exerted themselves in exhorting the people to peace and loyalty and the [feud?] of Caravets and Shanavests? Seems to be much in decline.  This is attributed very much to the effect produced upon the minds of the people (thro the clergy) by Buaonaparte’s conduct to the Pope and to Spain and much to the Effect of the many examples made at the last assizes especially those of corporal punishment and long imprisonments.  Any change for the better in the Conduct of the people is at present the more to rejoiced at because I learn from [?]  that the system of terror which the Insurgents had established has even at these assizes been so effectual as to render several prosecutions aborting in consequence of the Informants [deserting] their Informations and [?] in contradiction in contradiction to what they stated when giving them.  In some instances there have been prosecutions and convictions for perjury in such cases which I hope will have beneficial effects.

I return you many thanks for the Communication of the [publick] news which is very interesting and comfortable and shall give you the [hassle] of sending the enclosed packets.
Believe me with great regard my dear Sir Edward your very faithful and obliged humble servant
Charles Bushe
